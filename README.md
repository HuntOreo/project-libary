# Library - Odin Project

By Hunter Oreair, 2025

## What is it?
This is a simple app that allows the user to list books they are interested in.

The user can submit a new book, providing info such as the Title, Author, Publish Date, and Book Cover.
The user may also clarify if they have read the book or not, using the form checkbox.
Finally, the user can delete a book from the list as well as update the book cover, if they so desire.

This was done for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
