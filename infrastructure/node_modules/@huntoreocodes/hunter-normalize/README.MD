# Hunter's CSS Normalizer

This is my basic normalizer for css default styling.

## What is normalizing?
The goal of css normalizing is to fix styling inconsistencies between browsers. Each browser applies default styling to 
certain elements, and each browsers handles this differently.

This is different from *css resetting*, which aims to completely remove default styling on elements.

The bulk is done via [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize).
Ive also included some css styling taken from [this](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) article.

## What it changes
The major changes are done via [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize).
These changes include: 
- Fixes inconsistencies with default fonts.
- Applies a more readable tab size from 8 to 4.
- Changes base font.

Changes I've added include:
- Sets **line-height: 1.5** from 1.15 for readability.
- sets **max-inline-size: 100%** to insure images fit in containers on high-dpi mobile screens.
- Sets **box-sizing: border-box**.
